#  About Me:
Hey there! I’m Thomas from Lyon. I'm studying coding at 42 Lyon and really dig mobile development and making tools that make life easier for us devs. I’m still figuring out my exact path, but I love the tech world and all the cool stuff we can do with it.

I'm passionate about the power and potential of open source software. With a keen interest in collaborative development, I'm eager to engage with the open source community. My goal is to contribute my skills and effort to enrich this vibrant ecosystem. I hope to "ajouter ma pierre à l'édifice" — to add my stone to the edifice — by participating in projects that not only challenge me but also make a significant impact.

When I'm not coding, I serve as a volunteer firefighter, which instills in me a strong sense of community and teamwork. Otherwise, I’m probably chilling with a game controller in hand, listening to some tunes, or getting in some exercise. These things keep me sane and balanced.

I’m all about using tech to fix problems and improve our day-to-day. Keen to learn more, code more, and share more as I go along.
